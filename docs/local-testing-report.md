# Local Testing Report

- **Date**: 2025-09-27
- **Environment**: Node.js v22.14.0 (npm 10.9.2) on Linux (WSL)
- **Scope**: Execute quickstart checklist — dependency install, D1 migration + seed, contract tests.

## Steps Performed

1. Installed backend dependencies (`npm install` inside `backend/`).
2. Installed frontend dependencies (`npm install` inside `frontend/`).
3. Ran database setup scripts:
   - `npm run d1:migrate`
   - `npm run d1:seed`
4. Executed backend contract suite: `npm run test:contract`.

## Results

| Step | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Backend install | ✅ | No issues; moderate `npm audit` advisories remain. |
| Frontend install | ✅ | Same as above. |
| D1 migrate | ✅ | Wrangler 3.114.14 warns about deprecated `dev.persist` field and newer CLI 4.x release. |
| D1 seed | ✅ | Inserts completed; same Wrangler warnings as migrate. |
| Contract tests | ❌ | 24 failures, see below. |

### Contract Test Failures

- **Auth `/auth/twitter`**: expected OAuth `client_id` = `test-twitter-client-id`, but runtime returned `test_client_id`. Environment secrets/config need alignment with contract fixtures.
- **Health `/health`**: response includes `environment` and `version` fields and reports database status `"unknown"`, causing matcher to fail. Contract expects minimal shape with `database` connection indicator.
- **Tags suite**: all tag CRUD/association tests fail before requests execute. Test harness attempts to execute SQL via `testD1.prepare(...)` inside Miniflare stub and receives `false`, suggesting the helper can't talk to the Worker-bound D1 database after the repo changes. Likely requires updating `tests/helpers/app.ts` to run against the SQLite seed file or exported SQL rather than Miniflare proxy.

No manual Vite frontend smoke was performed; blocked on backend contract regressions above.

## Follow-Ups

1. Update OAuth config to expose the expected `test-twitter-client-id` when running locally (check `TwitterService` and env bindings).
2. Adjust `/health` payload or contract expectations to reintroduce `database` connectivity status and omit unexpected fields.
3. Rework tag test fixtures to run migrations/seeds via the new SQL pipeline (replace `testD1.prepare` usage or switch to wrangler CLI within tests).
4. After fixes, rerun `npm run test:contract` to confirm all suites pass.
