   → contracts/api.yaml: 4 endpoint groups (auth, users, tags, logs) with 11 total endpoints
   → research.md: Technology decisions and alternatives
   → quickstart.md: 6 user scenarios for testing
3. Generate tasks by category ✓
4. Apply task rules ✓
5. Number tasks sequentially ✓
6. Generate dependency graph ✓
7. Create parallel execution examples ✓
8. Execute implementation phases ✅ COMPLETED through Phase 3.4
```

```

## Next Steps Priority
🔥 **High Priority** (Production Readiness):
- T064 Update API documentation with examples
- T067 Run complete quickstart.md scenarios as acceptance tests
- Fix remaining test failures (database mocking)

🔄 **Medium Priority** (Quality Improvements):
- T058-T061 Unit tests for individual services
- T062 Performance tests
- T066 Refactor shared utilities

🚀 **Future Enhancements**:
- T063 Frontend responsive design validation
- T065 GitHub Flavored Markdown processing
- Production deployment on Cloudflare Workers

## Notes
- **[P] tasks**: Different files, no dependencies, can run in parallel
- **Sequential tasks**: Share files or have dependencies, must run in order  
- **TDD Critical**: All tests (T006-T029) must fail before implementation starts ✅ ACHIEVED
- **Mobile-first**: Frontend tasks prioritize responsive design
- **Cost-conscious**: Use Cloudflare free tiers (Workers, D1, KV)
- **Commit strategy**: Commit after each completed task

## Task Generation Rules Applied
1. **From Contracts**: api.yaml → 18 contract tests (T006-T023) ✅ COMPLETED
2. **From Data Model**: 6 entities → 6 model tasks (T030-T035) ✅ COMPLETED
3. **From User Stories**: quickstart.md → 6 integration tests (T024-T029) ✅ COMPLETED
4. **From Tech Stack**: Cloudflare Workers + Hono → specific setup tasks ✅ COMPLETED
5. **Dependencies**: Tests → Models → Services → Routes → Integration → Polish ✅ FOLLOWED
