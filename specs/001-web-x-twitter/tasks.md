## Next Steps Priority
🎉 **COMPLETED** - All implementation phases finished:
- ✅ T058-T067 All Polish tasks completed successfully
- ✅ Comprehensive unit test coverage (100+ tests)
- ✅ Performance optimization with caching system
- ✅ Security audit with production readiness confirmed
- ✅ Complete API and error handling documentation

� **Ready for Production Deployment**:
- Deploy to Cloudflare Workers
- Set up monitoring and alerting
- Implement recommended security improvements (rate limiting, session expiration)

� **Future Enhancements**:
- Frontend responsive design improvements
- Additional GitHub Flavored Markdown features
- Advanced analytics and user insights

## Notes
- **[P] tasks**: Different files, no dependencies, can run in parallel
- **Sequential tasks**: Share files or have dependencies, must run in order  
- **TDD Critical**: All tests (T006-T029) must fail before implementation starts ✅ ACHIEVED
- **Mobile-first**: Frontend tasks prioritize responsive design
- **Cost-conscious**: Use Cloudflare free tiers (Workers, D1, KV)
- **Commit strategy**: Commit after each completed task

## Task Generation Rules Applied
1. **From Contracts**: api.yaml → 18 contract tests (T006-T023) ✅ COMPLETED
2. **From Data Model**: 6 entities → 6 model tasks (T030-T035) ✅ COMPLETED
3. **From User Stories**: quickstart.md → 6 integration tests (T024-T029) ✅ COMPLETED
4. **From Tech Stack**: Cloudflare Workers + Hono → specific setup tasks ✅ COMPLETED
5. **Dependencies**: Tests → Models → Services → Routes → Integration → Polish ✅ FOLLOWED
