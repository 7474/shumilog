# Data Model: Docker Compose Development Environment

## Overview
This document defines the data model and configuration structures for the Docker Compose development environment. While this feature is primarily infrastructure-focused, it involves several configuration entities that need to be properly modeled.

## Configuration Entities

### Docker Compose Configuration
**Entity**: `DockerComposeConfig`
**Purpose**: Main orchestration configuration defining all services, networks, and volumes
**Attributes**:
- services: Collection of service definitions
- networks: Network configuration for inter-service communication
- volumes: Named volume definitions for data persistence
- version: Docker Compose file format version

**Relationships**:
- Contains multiple ServiceConfig entities
- References NetworkConfig and VolumeConfig entities

### Service Configuration
**Entity**: `ServiceConfig`
**Purpose**: Individual service definition (backend, frontend, database)
**Attributes**:
- name: Service identifier (backend, frontend, db)
- image: Container image or build context
- ports: Port mapping configuration
- volumes: Volume mount definitions
- environment: Environment variable configuration
- depends_on: Service dependency definitions
- healthcheck: Health monitoring configuration

**Validation Rules**:
- Port numbers must be unique across services
- Volume paths must be valid container paths
- Environment variables must follow naming conventions
- Health check commands must be valid container commands

**State Transitions**:
- created → starting → healthy → running → stopped

### Devcontainer Configuration
**Entity**: `DevcontainerConfig`
**Purpose**: VSCode development container configuration
**Attributes**:
- name: Development container name
- dockerComposeFile: Path to docker-compose.yml
- service: Primary development service name
- workspaceFolder: Container workspace path
- extensions: VSCode extensions to install
- settings: VSCode settings overrides
- postCreateCommand: Commands to run after container creation

**Relationships**:
- References DockerComposeConfig
- Specifies primary ServiceConfig for development

### Volume Configuration
**Entity**: `VolumeConfig`
**Purpose**: Data persistence and code mounting configuration
**Attributes**:
- name: Volume identifier
- type: Volume type (named, bind, tmpfs)
- source: Host path (for bind mounts)
- target: Container path
- read_only: Write permission flag

**Validation Rules**:
- Bind mount sources must exist on host
- Container paths must not conflict between services
- Named volumes must be declared in top-level volumes section

### Network Configuration
**Entity**: `NetworkConfig`
**Purpose**: Inter-service communication configuration
**Attributes**:
- name: Network identifier
- driver: Network driver type
- ipam: IP address management configuration
- attachable: External connection capability

**Relationships**:
- Connected to multiple ServiceConfig entities

### Environment Configuration
**Entity**: `EnvironmentConfig`
**Purpose**: Service-specific environment variables and secrets
**Attributes**:
- service: Target service name
- variables: Key-value pairs for environment variables
- files: References to .env files
- secrets: Secure variable references

**Validation Rules**:
- Variable names must follow environment variable conventions
- Secret references must point to valid secret definitions
- File paths must be accessible to the service

## Data Persistence Strategy

### Development Data
**Purpose**: Maintain development state across container restarts
**Implementation**: Named volumes for database, node_modules, build caches
**Lifecycle**: Persists until explicitly removed by developer

### Source Code
**Purpose**: Enable live code editing and hot-reload
**Implementation**: Bind mounts from host to container
**Lifecycle**: Reflects host filesystem in real-time

### Configuration Files
**Purpose**: Service configuration and environment setup
**Implementation**: Bind mounts for config files, env_file directives
**Lifecycle**: Managed through version control

## Service Dependencies

### Dependency Graph
```
frontend → backend → database
```

### Health Check Dependencies
- Database must be healthy before backend starts
- Backend must be running before frontend connects
- All services must report healthy status

### Startup Sequence
1. Database service starts and initializes
2. Database health check passes
3. Backend service starts and connects to database
4. Backend health check passes
5. Frontend service starts and connects to backend
6. All services report ready status

## Configuration Validation

### Startup Validation
- Port availability check
- Volume mount accessibility
- Environment variable completeness
- Service dependency resolution

### Runtime Validation
- Health check monitoring
- Resource usage tracking
- Service connectivity verification
- Log output monitoring

## Error Handling

### Common Error Scenarios
- Port conflicts with host services
- Volume permission issues
- Service startup failures
- Network connectivity problems

### Recovery Strategies
- Automatic restart policies for transient failures
- Clear error messages with resolution steps
- Graceful degradation for non-critical services
- Development-friendly debugging information

## Integration Points

### VSCode Integration
- Devcontainer automatic detection
- Integrated terminal access
- Debugging configuration
- Extension installation and configuration

### Testing Integration
- Test database initialization
- Test data seeding
- Isolated test environments
- CI/CD compatibility

### Development Workflow
- Hot-reload configuration
- File watching setup
- Build process integration
- Log aggregation and viewing
