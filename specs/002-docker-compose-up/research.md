# Research: Docker Compose Development Environment

## Overview
This document outlines the research and decisions made for implementing a comprehensive local development environment using Docker Compose and devcontainer configuration for the shumilog project.

## Technology Decisions

### Docker Compose Strategy
**Decision**: Use Docker Compose with multi-service configuration  
**Rationale**: 
- Enables single-command environment setup (`docker compose up`)
- Handles service dependencies and startup ordering automatically
- Provides isolated, reproducible development environment
- Supports hot-reloading through volume mounts

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Separate manual Docker containers: Rejected due to complexity of managing dependencies
- Local installation: Rejected due to environment inconsistency issues
- Docker Swarm: Rejected as over-engineered for single-developer hobby project

### Devcontainer Integration
**Decision**: Use VSCode devcontainer with Docker Compose integration  
**Rationale**:
- Provides consistent development environment across machines
- Integrates seamlessly with VSCode tooling
- Supports debugging and testing within containerized environment
- Maintains constitutional principle of simplicity

**Alternatives Considered**:
- GitHub Codespaces: Rejected due to potential costs beyond free tier
- Plain Docker without devcontainer: Rejected due to loss of IDE integration
- Local development only: Rejected due to environment consistency issues

### Service Architecture

#### Backend Service (Cloudflare Workers Compatible)
**Decision**: Use Node.js with Hono framework in development container  
**Rationale**:
- Maintains compatibility with Cloudflare Workers production environment
- Hono works well with both environments
- TypeScript support for consistent development experience
- Minimal resource usage aligns with cost-conscious principles

#### Frontend Service  
**Decision**: Use Vite development server with hot-reload  
**Rationale**:
- Fast development iteration cycles
- Built-in TypeScript support
- Minimal configuration required
- Well-documented and mainstream

#### Database Service
**Decision**: Use SQLite with volume persistence (mimicking Cloudflare D1)  
**Rationale**:
- Compatible with Cloudflare D1 production environment
- No additional hosting costs
- Simple setup and maintenance
- Supports realistic testing scenarios with proper seeding

### Development Workflow Integration

#### Hot Reloading
**Decision**: Implement file watching with volume mounts  
**Rationale**:
- Enables rapid development cycles
- No manual rebuild steps required
- Maintains state across code changes
- Standard practice for modern development

#### Testing Integration
**Decision**: Include test runners in service containers  
**Rationale**:
- Tests run in identical environment to application
- No local dependency management required
- Supports both unit and integration testing
- Maintains constitutional principle of simplicity

#### Port Management
**Decision**: Use standard port mapping with conflict detection  
**Rationale**:
- Backend: 8787 (Wrangler default)
- Frontend: 5173 (Vite default)
- Database: 3306 (if direct access needed)
- Predictable and well-documented ports

## Configuration Approach

### Environment Variables
**Decision**: Use `.env` files with Docker Compose env_file directive  
**Rationale**:
- Simple configuration management
- Environment-specific overrides supported
- No complex secret management needed for development
- Constitutional compliance with simplicity principles

### Volume Strategy
**Decision**: Use named volumes for persistence, bind mounts for source code  
**Rationale**:
- Source code changes immediately reflected (bind mounts)
- Database persistence across container restarts (named volumes)
- Node modules cached for faster startup (named volumes)
- Clear separation of concerns

### Network Configuration
**Decision**: Use Docker Compose default networking with service discovery  
**Ratational**:
- Services can communicate using service names
- No complex networking configuration required
- Isolated from host network for security
- Supports standard development patterns

## Implementation Considerations

### Startup Dependencies
**Decision**: Use `depends_on` with healthchecks  
**Rationale**:
- Ensures database is ready before backend starts
- Prevents race conditions during startup
- Provides clear error messages for debugging
- Standard Docker Compose pattern

### Development vs Production Parity
**Decision**: Maintain reasonable parity while optimizing for development experience  
**Rationale**:
- Use similar technology stack (TypeScript, SQLite-compatible)
- Different deployment mechanism acceptable for development speed
- Configuration differences documented and justified
- Focus on functional parity over infrastructure parity

### Resource Optimization
**Decision**: Minimize container resource usage  
**Rationale**:
- Supports development on resource-constrained machines
- Faster startup times improve iteration cycles
- Aligns with cost-conscious constitutional principles
- No performance penalties for hobby-scale usage

## Risk Mitigation

### Port Conflicts
**Strategy**: Document common conflicts and provide alternative configurations
**Implementation**: Include port override options in documentation

### Volume Permission Issues
**Strategy**: Use appropriate user mapping and file permissions
**Implementation**: Configure containers to match host user permissions

### Service Startup Timing
**Strategy**: Implement proper healthchecks and wait conditions
**Implementation**: Use Docker Compose healthcheck directives

## Success Criteria
- Single `docker compose up` command starts all services
- Code changes reflect immediately without container rebuild
- Database persists across container restarts
- All existing tests pass in containerized environment
- Development workflow remains fast and intuitive
- Zero additional operational costs
