# Feature Specification: Docker Compose Development Environment

**Feature Branch**: `002-docker-compose-up`  
**Created**: September 26, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "現状はローカルマシンでの動作確認を行えないため、docker compose upでローカルマシン上で総合的な動作確認が行えるように構成します。"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → Feature request: Enable comprehensive local testing via Docker Compose
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Actors: Developers, QA testers
   → Actions: Local development, testing, debugging
   → Data: Application services, database, dependencies
   → Constraints: Single command deployment, comprehensive testing capability
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → All aspects clear from description
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → Clear user flow: developers need one-command local environment
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → Each requirement testable via docker compose commands
6. Identify Key Entities
   → Services: backend, frontend, database, dependencies
7. Run Review Checklist
   → No ambiguities or implementation details
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ⚡ Quick Guidelines
- ✅ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ❌ Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- 👥 Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer working on the shumilog project, I need to run the entire application stack locally with a single command so that I can perform comprehensive testing, debugging, and development work without requiring external services or complex setup procedures.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a fresh development machine with Docker installed, **When** I run `docker compose up`, **Then** the entire application stack starts successfully and is accessible for testing
2. **Given** the application is running via Docker Compose, **When** I make code changes, **Then** the changes are reflected in the running application without requiring manual rebuilds
3. **Given** the Docker Compose environment is running, **When** I access the application through a web browser, **Then** I can perform all user workflows including authentication, logging, and tag management
4. **Given** I want to test database operations, **When** the Docker Compose environment is running, **Then** I have access to a properly seeded test database
5. **Given** I need to debug the application, **When** using the Docker Compose environment, **Then** I can access logs and debugging information for all services

### Edge Cases
- What happens when services fail to start due to port conflicts?
- How does the system handle database migration and seeding on first startup?
- What occurs when dependencies between services cause startup timing issues?
- How are environment variables and configuration managed across different services?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a single `docker compose up` command that starts all necessary services for local development
- **FR-002**: System MUST include all application services (backend, frontend, database) in the Docker Compose configuration
- **FR-003**: System MUST automatically handle service dependencies and startup ordering
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide persistent data storage for development sessions
- **FR-005**: System MUST enable hot-reloading or live updates when source code changes
- **FR-006**: System MUST expose all necessary ports for local access and testing
- **FR-007**: System MUST include proper database seeding for realistic testing scenarios
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide clear logging and debugging capabilities for all services
- **FR-009**: System MUST handle environment configuration appropriate for local development
- **FR-010**: System MUST allow developers to run the full test suite against the local environment

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Development Environment**: Complete local setup that mirrors production functionality
- **Service Configuration**: Individual service definitions with proper networking and dependencies
- **Data Persistence**: Volume management for databases and file storage
- **Environment Variables**: Configuration management for different services and environments
