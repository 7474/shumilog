# Feature Specification: Minimal Cloudflare Worker API Revival

**Feature Branch**: `003-specs-001-web`  
**Created**: 2025-09-26  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "全く動作しないアプリケーションになっているため specs/001-web-x-twitter/contracts/api.yaml をCloudflare Workersでのホスティング想定で動作させるための最小構成に再生します。不要なファイルは一切容赦なく削除します。READMEにあっかれた手順を踏めばローカルマシンでアプリケーションが動作することが目標です。"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer tasked with reviving the project, I need to run a minimal version of the application locally via the documented Cloudflare Workers flow so that I can verify the API contract in `specs/001-web-x-twitter/contracts/api.yaml` without wrestling with broken or irrelevant components.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a freshly cloned repository and the prerequisites listed in the README, **When** the developer follows the documented local run steps, **Then** the API endpoints described in `api.yaml` respond successfully through the Cloudflare Workers development environment.
2. **Given** the curated project files after cleanup, **When** the developer inspects the repository structure, **Then** only the assets required for the minimal Cloudflare Worker setup remain and no deleted components are referenced by the README or runtime flow.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the developer lacks a Cloudflare account or required tokens—are alternative local run instructions provided or must the user obtain credentials? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: clarify credential expectations]
- How does the system behave if a contract endpoint remains unimplemented or returns an error despite the minimal setup?
- What occurs if the README prerequisites are missing tooling versions or operating-system-specific steps?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The project MUST expose a runnable minimal application that serves the endpoints defined in `specs/001-web-x-twitter/contracts/api.yaml` through the Cloudflare Workers local environment so that contract testing can proceed.
- **FR-002**: The README MUST provide an accurate, sequential local run guide that enables a developer to start the application from scratch and confirm API availability via documented verification steps.
- **FR-003**: The repository MUST exclude components, services, or assets that are not required for the minimal Cloudflare Worker scenario, while ensuring no remaining documentation references removed items. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: define criteria for "不要なファイル"]
- **FR-004**: The system MUST include a simple validation procedure (manual or automated) that confirms API conformity after running the README instructions (e.g., sample requests and expected responses summarized for each core endpoint).
- **FR-005**: The project MUST call out any mandatory external dependencies (accounts, environment variables, tooling versions) so that developers understand what must be prepared before running the local flow.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Minimal Cloudflare API Surface**: Represents the subset of endpoints and behaviors from `api.yaml` that the revived application must honor, including request/response structures and success criteria.
- **Developer Runbook**: Represents the README-driven instructions, prerequisites, and validation steps that guide a developer from clone to verified API responses.
