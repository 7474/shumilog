# Implementation Plan: Cloudflare Workers & D1 Deployment Architecture

**Branch**: `003-web-cloudflare-cloudflare` | **Date**: 2025-09-26 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/003-web-cloudflare-cloudflare/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code or `AGENTS.md` for opencode).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
Refactor shumilog application to run properly both locally and on Cloudflare Workers platform with D1 database. Primary requirement is establishing consistent development-to-production workflow using Cloudflare's official tools and practices. Local development will use devcontainer for virtualization and stable environment, with D1 local emulation through Wrangler. Production deployment targets Cloudflare Workers with D1 database binding. Focus is on initial setup, verification, and standardized procedures following Cloudflare official documentation.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.2+ (latest stable), Node.js 18+  
**Primary Dependencies**: Hono (web framework), Wrangler CLI (Cloudflare tooling), Vite (frontend), Vitest (testing)  
**Storage**: Cloudflare D1 (SQLite-compatible) for both local and production  
**Testing**: Vitest for unit/integration tests, miniflare for Workers emulation  
**Target Platform**: Cloudflare Workers (serverless) + local devcontainer environment
**Project Type**: web - backend/frontend structure with Workers deployment  
**Performance Goals**: <10s startup, <30s migrations, hobby-scale performance  
**Constraints**: Cloudflare Workers runtime limits, D1 operation limits, free tier cost constraints  
**Scale/Scope**: Single hobby project, development setup focus, following official Cloudflare guidance

**Additional Context from User**: Must adhere to Cloudflare official documentation and best practices. Local development uses devcontainer for virtualization and isolated environment. Priority is stable, independent local setup that mirrors production Workers environment. Docker compose can be replaced if better virtualization solution exists.

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Quick Experimentation**: ✅ PASS - Feature focuses on establishing rapid development workflow with hot-reload and quick deployment cycles. Wrangler provides instant local testing that mirrors production.

**Low-Cost Hosting**: ✅ PASS - Cloudflare Workers free tier provides 100k requests/day, D1 free tier provides 5M reads/month. No paid services required for hobby scale. Devcontainer uses local resources only.

**Iterative Exploration**: ✅ PASS - Implementation starts with minimal viable local setup, then extends to production deployment. Can be built incrementally with each step testable.

**Simplicity First**: ✅ PASS - Uses mainstream Cloudflare tools (Wrangler, D1) with extensive documentation. TypeScript and Hono are simple, well-understood choices. Devcontainer is standard practice.

**Cost-Conscious Development**: ✅ PASS - All tools free/open source. Cloudflare free tiers sufficient for hobby project. No paid third-party services. Development uses local compute only.

*No violations detected. Ready for research phase.*

# Option 3: Mobile + API (when "iOS/Android" detected)

```

**Structure Decision**: [DEFAULT to Option 1 unless Technical Context indicates web/mobile app]

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh copilot`
     **IMPORTANT**: Execute it exactly as specified above. Do not add or remove any arguments.
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate infrastructure setup tasks from research.md and data-model.md
- Create contract test tasks for each API endpoint (health, dev-config, dev-migrate) [P]
- Configuration tasks for devcontainer, Wrangler, environment setup
- Integration test tasks from quickstart.md validation scenarios
- Implementation tasks following TDD order to make tests pass

**Specific Task Categories**:
1. **Infrastructure Setup** (devcontainer, Wrangler config)
2. **Database Setup** (migrations, D1 local/production setup)
3. **Contract Tests** (API endpoint validation) [P]
4. **Development Endpoints** (health, dev-config, dev-migrate implementation)
5. **Environment Management** (secrets, configuration validation)
6. **Integration Tests** (quickstart scenario validation)
7. **Documentation** (setup procedures, troubleshooting)

**Ordering Strategy**:
- Infrastructure first: devcontainer → Wrangler config → D1 setup
- TDD order: Contract tests → endpoint implementation → integration tests
- Environment-specific: Local development → production deployment
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent configuration files)

**Estimated Output**: 20-25 numbered, ordered tasks focused on deployment architecture setup

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
