# Feature Specification: Cloudflare Workers & D1 Deployment Architecture

**Feature Branch**: `003-web-cloudflare-cloudflare`  
**Created**: 2025-09-26  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Webアプリケーションとしてローカル、Cloudflare向けそれぞれに構成されていません。まずローカルマシンで動作するようにします。Cloudflare worker上で動作するものにします。データベースにはD1を用います。この前提で一次資料に当たりつつリファクタリングします。"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → Feature description parsed: Refactor application architecture for proper local and Cloudflare deployment
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Actors: developers, users
   → Actions: configure, refactor, deploy
   → Data: application code, database schema
   → Constraints: must work locally and on Cloudflare Workers with D1
3. No unclear aspects identified - requirements are clear
4. User Scenarios & Testing section filled
5. Functional Requirements generated - all testable
6. Key Entities identified (infrastructure components)
7. Review Checklist - no implementation details, focused on deployment capabilities
8. SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
Developers need to be able to run the shumilog application both locally for development and on Cloudflare Workers for production. The application must use Cloudflare D1 database in both environments, with proper configuration management and deployment processes. Local development should closely mirror the production Cloudflare environment.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a developer has the codebase, **When** they run the local development setup, **Then** the application starts successfully using local D1 database emulation
2. **Given** a developer makes code changes locally, **When** they test the application, **Then** it behaves identically to the production Cloudflare environment
3. **Given** the application is ready for deployment, **When** developers run the deployment process, **Then** it successfully deploys to Cloudflare Workers with D1 database
4. **Given** the application is running on Cloudflare Workers, **When** users access it, **Then** all functionality works correctly with D1 database operations
5. **Given** database schema changes are needed, **When** developers run migrations, **Then** they apply successfully to both local and production D1 instances

### Edge Cases
- What happens when local D1 emulation is unavailable or fails to start?
- How does the system handle D1 connection failures in Cloudflare Workers environment?
- What happens when database migrations fail during deployment?
- How are environment-specific configurations managed between local and production?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST run successfully in local development environment using Cloudflare D1 local emulation
- **FR-002**: System MUST deploy and run successfully on Cloudflare Workers platform
- **FR-003**: System MUST use Cloudflare D1 database for all data persistence in both local and production environments
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide database migration capabilities for both local and production D1 instances
- **FR-005**: System MUST handle environment-specific configuration (local vs production settings)
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide health checks to verify D1 database connectivity in both environments
- **FR-007**: System MUST support hot-reload functionality during local development
- **FR-008**: System MUST handle D1 database connection errors gracefully in both environments
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide proper logging and error reporting for both local and Cloudflare environments
- **FR-010**: System MUST maintain data consistency and integrity across D1 database operations
- **FR-011**: System MUST support development workflow with local testing before Cloudflare deployment
- **FR-012**: System MUST provide clear deployment and setup documentation

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **NFR-001**: Local development environment MUST closely mirror Cloudflare Workers runtime behavior
- **NFR-002**: Database migrations MUST complete within reasonable time limits (under 30 seconds)
- **NFR-003**: Application startup MUST complete within 10 seconds in both environments
- **NFR-004**: D1 database operations MUST handle concurrent requests appropriately
- **NFR-005**: Configuration management MUST prevent accidental production deployments with development settings

### Key Entities
- **Local Development Environment**: Wrangler dev server with D1 local emulation, hot-reload capabilities, development-specific configuration
- **Cloudflare Workers Environment**: Production runtime with D1 database binding, production configuration, proper error handling
- **D1 Database Instance**: Both local (emulated) and production instances with identical schema, migration support, connection pooling
- **Configuration Management**: Environment-specific settings, secrets management, deployment configurations
- **Migration System**: Database schema versioning, rollback capabilities, validation checks
