# Feature Specification: Dependency Maintenance Policy and LTS Alignment

**Feature Branch**: `[004-lts-lts]`  
**Created**: 2025-09-27  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "全体的にパッケージバージョンが古いので、アップデートするとともに依存関係の維持ポリシーを定めます。原則としてLTSがあるものはLTS、そうではないものは安定最新版を用います。"

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-27
- Q: How often should the organization run the formal dependency review cadence covering all backend and frontend packages? → A: Quarterly (every 3 months)
- Q: Once a new LTS (or latest stable) version is identified, how long is the standard upgrade grace period before escalation? → A: 60 days
- Q: When a critical security advisory affecting a dependency lands between scheduled reviews, what response window should the policy mandate for mitigation or documented risk acceptance? → A: Triage within 24h, mitigation within 72h
- Q: Who must approve temporary exceptions when a dependency cannot meet the policy within the grace period? → A: Cross-functional review board
- Q: How far in advance should stakeholders be notified about scheduled dependency upgrades captured in the quarterly review? → A: At least 2 weeks

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As the engineering lead responsible for platform reliability, I need clear guidance and visibility on dependency versions so the team can keep every runtime and library aligned to the latest LTS release (or latest stable when LTS is unavailable) without risking service disruption.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a dependency that publishes LTS releases, **When** the scheduled policy review occurs, **Then** the dependency’s target version is documented as the current LTS with a deadline for completing the upgrade and communication to relevant teams at least two weeks before implementation.
2. **Given** a dependency that does not offer an LTS channel, **When** the policy review occurs, **Then** the latest stable version is recorded with a plan for validating compatibility and a checkpoint for confirming the upgrade completion.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a dependency’s latest LTS is incompatible with existing critical functionality and postponement is required?
- How does the organization handle emergency security advisories released between scheduled reviews, given the 24h triage and 72h mitigation policy?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The organization MUST maintain a centralized inventory of all platform dependencies, including current version, available LTS or stable channels, and business owners.
- **FR-002**: The policy MUST mandate adoption of LTS releases within 60 days of availability, triggering escalation paths for overdue items.
- **FR-003**: The policy MUST schedule a quarterly review cadence for dependencies to capture the latest LTS or stable releases.
- **FR-004**: Stakeholders MUST receive advance communication outlining upcoming upgrades, impact assessments, and expected testing checkpoints at least two weeks before implementation.
- **FR-005**: Releases MUST include a compliance check that blocks deployment if dependencies fall outside the policy’s acceptable version ranges, unless an approved exception is documented.
- **FR-006**: Exception handling MUST define conditions for temporary deviations (e.g., incompatibility, vendor delays), require cross-functional review board approval, and capture documented mitigation timelines.
- **FR-007**: The policy MUST require critical security advisories to be triaged within 24 hours and mitigated (or risk-accepted with executive approval) within 72 hours.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Dependency Inventory**: Represents each third-party or platform dependency, capturing current version, target version, release channel (LTS or stable), review status, owner, and exception notes.
- **Maintenance Policy Record**: Stores the policy decisions, including review cadence, escalation contacts, cross-functional review board membership for exceptions, approval workflow, and communication templates shared with stakeholders.
