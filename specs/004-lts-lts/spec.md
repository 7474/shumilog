# Feature Specification: Dependency Maintenance Policy and LTS Alignment

**Feature Branch**: `[004-lts-lts]`  
**Created**: 2025-09-27  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "全体的にパッケージバージョンが古いので、アップデートするとともに依存関係の維持ポリシーを定めます。原則としてLTSがあるものはLTS、そうではないものは安定最新版を用います。"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As the engineering lead responsible for platform reliability, I need clear guidance and visibility on dependency versions so the team can keep every runtime and library aligned to the latest LTS release (or latest stable when LTS is unavailable) without risking service disruption.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a dependency that publishes LTS releases, **When** the scheduled policy review occurs, **Then** the dependency’s target version is documented as the current LTS with a deadline for completing the upgrade and communicating the change to relevant teams.
2. **Given** a dependency that does not offer an LTS channel, **When** the policy review occurs, **Then** the latest stable version is recorded with a plan for validating compatibility and a checkpoint for confirming the upgrade completion.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a dependency’s latest LTS is incompatible with existing critical functionality and postponement is required?
- How does the organization handle emergency security advisories released between scheduled reviews?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The organization MUST maintain a centralized inventory of all platform dependencies, including current version, available LTS or stable channels, and business owners.
- **FR-002**: The policy MUST mandate adoption of LTS releases within a defined grace period once they become available, with escalation paths for overdue items.
- **FR-003**: The policy MUST specify a recurring review cadence for dependencies [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: confirm expected frequency, e.g., monthly or quarterly].
- **FR-004**: Stakeholders MUST receive advance communication outlining upcoming upgrades, impact assessments, and expected testing checkpoints.
- **FR-005**: Releases MUST include a compliance check that blocks deployment if dependencies fall outside the policy’s acceptable version ranges, unless an approved exception is documented.
- **FR-006**: Exception handling MUST define conditions for temporary deviations (e.g., incompatibility, vendor delays) and require documented mitigation timelines.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Dependency Inventory**: Represents each third-party or platform dependency, capturing current version, target version, release channel (LTS or stable), review status, owner, and exception notes.
- **Maintenance Policy Record**: Stores the policy decisions, including review cadence, escalation contacts, approval workflow for exceptions, and communication templates shared with stakeholders.
