## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user, I want to log in, manage my Tags, and manage my Logs, so I can track my interests and activities effectively.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1.  **Given** I am an unauthenticated user on the landing page, **When** I click the login button, **Then** I am redirected to the Twitter authentication page.
2.  **Given** I have successfully authenticated with Twitter, **When** I am redirected back to the application, **Then** I am on the main dashboard.
3.  **Given** I am logged in, **When** I navigate to the "Tags" section, **Then** I see a list of all my created tags.
4.  **Given** I am in the "Tags" section, **When** I create a new tag with a name, **Then** it appears in the tag list.
5.  **Given** I am in the "Tags" section, **When** I edit an existing tag's name, **Then** the name is updated in the tag list.
6.  **Given** I am logged in, **When** I navigate to the "Logs" section, **Then** I see a list of my recent logs.
7.  **Given** I am in the "Logs" section, **When** I create a new log with content and associate it with tags, **Then** it appears at the top of my log list.

### Edge Cases
- What happens if Twitter authentication fails? The user should see an error message.
- How does the system handle an attempt to create a tag that already exists? The system will automatically select the existing tag for the user.
- What is displayed if a user has no logs or no tags? A message indicating the empty state should be shown.

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-28
- Q: How should the system handle an attempt to create a tag that already exists? → A: Automatically select the existing tag for the user.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The system MUST allow users to initiate login via a "Login with Twitter" button.
- **FR-002**: The system MUST handle the OAuth callback from Twitter to establish a user session.
- **FR-003**: Authenticated users MUST be able to view a list of their tags.
- **FR-004**: Authenticated users MUST be able to create new tags.
- **FR-005**: If a user attempts to create a tag that already exists, the system MUST automatically select the existing tag instead of creating a duplicate.
- **FR-006**: Authenticated users MUST be able to edit the names of existing tags.
- **FR-007**: Authenticated users MUST be able to delete tags.
- **FR-008**: Authenticated users MUST be able to view a paginated list of their logs.
- **FR-009**: Authenticated users MUST be able to create a new log entry.
- **FR-010**: Authenticated users MUST be able to edit an existing log entry.
- **FR-011**: Authenticated users MUST be able to delete a log entry.
- **FR-012**: The system MUST provide a mechanism for users to log out.

- **Tag**: Represents a label for categorizing logs. It has a name.
